# Human Activity Recognition using PyTorch

This is an exercise to implement a few deep learning models for recognising human activities (like walking, standing, etc) from sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) collected from mobile phones.

We use Jason Brownlee's tutorial (in Keras) as a source of inspiration and look to implement the models in PyTorch.

## Pre-requisites
    Python 3.7
    Pytorch 1.4
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    seaborn
    jupyter

    tensorflow 2.1 (if you are running the tensorflow notebook)

## How to

- pip install the obove required libraries
- Open terminal and cd to this root folder
- Run jupyter notebook from the root folder
- Open the human_activity_recognition.ipynb notebook
- The notebook is fairly self explanatory.
